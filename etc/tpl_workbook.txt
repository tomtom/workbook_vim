*workbook.txt*  Interactively work with interpreteted languages (R etc.)
                Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

The goal of this plugin is to provide a similar user experience as 
Mathematica or Jupyter (within the limits of a text editor like vim).

Features~
- Run an interpreter as an inferior process.
- Provide means to evaluate code in this process (asynchronously without 
  blocking vim).
- Insert (or dynamically update) results right into the source code.
- Transcribe the interaction with the interpreter.
- Provide code completion (see 'omnifunc') for supported filetypes.

How it works: When evaluating a piece of code~
- The code is sent to the interpreter.
- A placeholder is inserted in the source code.
- Upon receiving the result, the placeholder is being replaced with the 
  result

How to use this plugin~
- Open a file with a supported filetype.
- Type |:Workbook| or add the filetype to 
  |g:workbook_autosetup_filetypes| to automatically enable the workbook 
  mode for the specified filetypes.
- Press <c-cr> to evaluate the current paragraph.
- Press <localleader>w<F1> for help on other commands and maps.

The following filetypes are supported~
- R (supports code completion)
- vim
- sh (default: bash)

Currenty, the main use case is to interact with R. Other than other vim 
plugins, the workbook plugin has no non-vim dependencies and works at 
least on Linux and Windows with no problems. The vim and the bash 
backend are mostly there to get the code right.
