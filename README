The goal of this plugin is to provide a similar user experience as 
Mathematica or Jupyter (within the limits of a text editor like vim).

Features~
- Run an interpreter as an inferior process.
- Provide means to evaluate code in this process (asynchronously without 
  blocking vim).
- Insert (or dynamically update) results right into the source code.
- Transcribe the interaction with the interpreter.
- Provide code completion (see 'omnifunc') for supported filetypes.

How it works~
- Send code to the interpreter.
- A placeholder is inserted in the source code.
- Upon receiving the result, the placeholder is being replaced with the 
  result

The following filetypes are supported~
- R (supports code completion)
- vim
- sh (default: bash)

Currenty, the main use case is to interact with R. Other than other vim 
plugins, the workbook plugin has no non-vim dependencies and works at 
least on Linux and Windows with no problems. The vim and the bash 
backend are mostly there to get the code right.

How to use this plugin~
- Open a file with a supported filetype.
- Type |:Workbook| or add the filetype to 
  |g:workbook_autosetup_filetypes| to automatically enable the workbook 
  mode for the specified filetypes.
- Press <c-cr> to evaluate the current paragraph.
- Press <localleader>w<F1> for help on other commands and maps.
