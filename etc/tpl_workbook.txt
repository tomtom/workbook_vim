*workbook.txt*  Notebook-like interaction with R etc.
                Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

The long-term goal of this plugin is to provide notebook-like interaction with 
interpreted languages similar to the Mathematica or Jupyter (within the limits 
of a text editor like vim).

Features~
- Run an interpreter as an inferior process.
- Send code to this process (asynchronously without blocking vim).
- Insert (or dynamically update) the results into the source code (as 
  commented out block below the respective source code).
- Transcribe the interaction with the interpreter.
- Provide code completion (see 'omnifunc') for supported filetypes.

How to use this plugin~
- Open a file with a supported filetype (see below or 
  |workbook#GetSupportedFiletypes()|).
- Type |:Workbook| or add the filetype to 
  |g:workbook_autosetup_filetypes| to automatically enable the workbook 
  mode for the specified filetypes.
- Press <c-cr> to evaluate the current paragraph.
- Press <localleader>w<F1> for help on other commands and maps.

The following filetypes are supported~
- R (supports code completion)
- vim
- sh (default: bash)

Currenty, the main use case is to interact with R. Other than other 
well-known R-related vim plugins, the workbook plugin has no non-vim 
dependencies and works at least on Linux and Windows with no problems. 
The vim and the bash backend are mostly there to get the code right.
